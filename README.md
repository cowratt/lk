# lk

lk is a text-based game. I designed it to be as difficult as possible, but still fully playable. It is nowhere near complete.

The code is also written as poorly as possible, in order to test the limitations of JavaScript. It functions primarily by hot-swapping its own codebase. Somehow, it works.
